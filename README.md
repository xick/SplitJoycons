# SplitJoycons
SplitJoycons is a simple homebrew utility for Switch to set joycons in horizontal/split mode.
This is useful if SL/SR buttons are broken and want to change grip in horizontal mode, allowing 2-players controls in games. 

## Requirements
This utility requires Switch with access to the Homebrew Menu. 

## Usage

When running simply detach joycons and return to your game by pressing Home Button.
